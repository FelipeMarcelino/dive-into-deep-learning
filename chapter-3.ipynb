    "This chapter begins with the explenation of how predictive models can make our lives easier. Summarily,the authors introduce the existing types of machine learning tasks. These types are:\n",
    "-  Supervised Learning: addresses the task of predicting targets given input data. These targets can be some sort of class, such as, animals: cat, dog. They can also be continuous numbers, such as in the case of regressions. The authors exemplified regression with the task: given input data, trying to predict the price of a car or a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning: In this subfield, tasks don't have labels, only the input data/features.  Some example tasks are: clustering(grouping data by their features), principal component analysis(dimensionality reduction of data and representation learning(for example,represent a set of words using a dense vector)"
